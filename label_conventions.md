overriding schema for labels:

male / female / monster  / environment

a scene is considered “environment” if the subject of the picture is the environment (either no figures or figures are very small in the scene)

genre (“scifi”, “fantasy”, “dnd”, etc)

if you define a label like “elf” you need to define it’s opposite so that the label matters (in this case “human”)
“male” “human” vs. “male” “elf"

be specific but also broad: "dark elf” gets added as “dark” and “elf”, but also add “drow”.

include artist names (“mike” “mignola”)

original image platform (“artstation", “behance”, “cover” “vogue”, etc)

image type (“photo”, “painting”, “mural”, “graffiti" etc)

include both plural and singular descriptors.
if there are two wolves in the picture both “wolf” and “wolves” get added.

gender descriptors are always singular (“male” and “female”) and are only added if there is a single, primary figure in the picture.

something is “male" or “female" if a discernible gender can be found
(a male face on a lion would be both “male” and “monster”.)
(a mummy with breasts would be “monster” and “female”.)
(a male centaur is “horse” “centaur” “male”.)

describe the scene in broad and specific terms. “forest” “trees” “grove” “oak"

if a picture can be described with an emotion, do so.
“happy” “sad” “scary” “creepy” “crazy"

describe features of figures, but focus on the most pronounced / defining traits, and be broad, but also specific when doing so.
“wings” “bat”, “angle” “wings” “bird” “feather”, “tail” “scorpion”
