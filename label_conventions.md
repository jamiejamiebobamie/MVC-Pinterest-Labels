overriding schema for labels:

male / female / monster  / environment

a scene is considered “environment” if the subject of the picture is the environment (either no figures or figures are very small in the scene)

genre (“scifi”, “fantasy”, “dnd”, etc)

if you define a label like “elf” you need to define it’s opposite so that the label matters (in this case “human”)
“male” “human” vs. “male” “elf"

be specific but also broad: "dark elf” gets added as “dark” and “elf”, but also add “drow”.

include artist names (“mike” “mignola”)

original image platform (“artstation", “behance”, “cover” “vogue”, etc)

image type (“photo”, “painting”, “mural”, “graffiti" etc)

include both plural and singular descriptors if there are more than one of something in an image.
if there are two wolves in the picture both “wolf” and “wolves” get added.

gender descriptors are always singular (“male” and “female”) and are only added if there is a single, primary figure in the picture.

something is “male" or “female" if a discernible (human) gender can be found
(a male face on a lion would be both “male” “monster” and "lion".)
(a mummy with breasts would be “monster” and “female”.)
(a male centaur is “male” "monster".)

a subject is a monster if non human characteristics are displayed and those nonhuman characteristics are prominent features.
an elf for simplicity will not fall into the category of monster, but a centaur will. as while both elf and centaur are classically considered as fantasy races, a centaur has prominent nonhuman features, while an elf has exagerated or atypical human traits. 

describe the scene in broad and specific terms. “forest” “trees” “grove” “oak"

if a picture can be described with an emotion, do so.
“happy” “sad” “scary” “creepy” “crazy"

describe features of figures, but focus on the most pronounced / defining traits, and be broad, but also specific when doing so.
“wings” “bat”, “angel” “wings” “bird” “feather”, “tail” “scorpion”

action verbs should be included if there is a singular figure in the picture and he is doing something (even "standing")

I MIGHT CROP THE IMAGES SO IGNORE:
    the label "full_body" is one of the only underscored: "_" labels and denotes if the entire body is in the picture and should only be used on pictures with a single or primary figure in the frame.

NOT NECESSARY:
    the label "white_" is another underscored: "_" label and denotes that the figure is surrounded by a white (or solid of one color) background with the only color or B/W aspects being in the figure itself. (not really necessary as these images usually already have a #fffff hexCode label.) (does a black background get included in this category?)

the labels: monster, environment, male, female and misc will be applied to every picture.
monster, environment, male, and female are used when there is a single primary subject of the image.
and the subject may be a mix of these four traits.
EXAMPLE:
(male, monster, environment) (female, monster) (male, female) (environment) (male)

misc will be applied to images that do not have a primary subject (an image of a group or couple) or if the subject matter is abstract
